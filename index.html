                <p class="recipie-title">Meatball</p>
                <p class="recipie-details">A meatball is ground meat rolled into a small ball, sometimes along with
                    other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning. Meatballs are
                    cooked by frying, baking, steaming, or braising in sauce.</p>

                <p class="recipie-title">Pasta</p>
                <p class="recipie-details">Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat
                    flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or
                    baking</p>

                <p class="recipie-title">Steak</p>
                <p class="recipie-details">A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially
                    including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an
                    attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.</p>
